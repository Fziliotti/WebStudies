There are four different phases of component’s lifecycle:

Initialization: In this phase, the component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.

Mounting: The react component is ready to mount to the DOM. This phase covers the getDerivedStateFromProps and componentDidMount lifecycle methods.

Updating: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers the getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate lifecycle methods.

Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes the componentWillUnmount lifecycle method.

Error Handling: In this phase, the component is called whenever there's an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor for any child component. This phase includes the componentDidCatch lifecycle method.
