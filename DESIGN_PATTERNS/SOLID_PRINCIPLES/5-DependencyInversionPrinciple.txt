Dependency should be on abstractions not concretions
A. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.


There comes a point in software development where our app will be largely composed of modules. When this happens, we have to clear things up by using dependency injection. High-level components depending on low-level components to function.

class XMLHttpService extends XMLHttpRequestService {}
class Http {
    constructor(private xmlhttpService: XMLHttpService) { }
    get(url: string , options: any) {
        this.xmlhttpService.request(url,'GET');
    }
    post() {
        this.xmlhttpService.request(url,'POST');
    }
    //...
}
Here, Http is the high-level component whereas HttpService is the low-level component. This design violates DIP A: High-level modules should not depend on low-level level modules. It should depend upon its abstraction.

Ths Http class is forced to depend upon the XMLHttpService class. If we were to change to change the Http connection service, maybe we want to connect to the internet through Nodejs or even Mock the http service. We will painstakingly have to move through all the instances of Http to edit the code and this violates the OCP principle.

The Http class should care less the type of Http service you are using. We make a Connection interface:

interface Connection {
    request(url: string, opts:any);
}
The Connection interface has a request method. With this, we pass in an argument of type Connection to our Http class:

class Http {
    constructor(private httpConnection: Connection) { }
    get(url: string , options: any) {
        this.httpConnection.request(url,'GET');
    }
    post() {
        this.httpConnection.request(url,'POST');
    }
    //...
}
So now, no matter the type of Http connection service passed to Http it can easily connect to a network without bothering to know the type of network connection.

We can now re-implement our XMLHttpService class to implement the Connection interface:

class XMLHttpService implements Connection {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    //...
    request(url: string, opts:any) {
        xhr.open();
        xhr.send();
    }
}
We can create many Http Connection types and pass it to our Http class without any fuss about errors.

class NodeHttpService implements Connection {
    request(url: string, opts:any) {
        //...
    }
}
class MockHttpService implements Connection {
    request(url: string, opts:any) {
        //...
    }    
}
Now, we can see that both high-level modules and low-level modules depend on abstractions. Http class(high level module) depends on the Connection interface(abstraction) and the Http service types(low level modules) in turn, depends on the Connection interface(abstraction).

Also, this DIP will force us not to violate the Liskov Substitution Principle: The Connection types Node-XML-MockHttpService are substitutable for their parent type Connection.
